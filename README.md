# Meme Generator

## Overview
This is a meme generator created with React.

## Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- React
- Tailwind CSS

## Continued Development
- Fix the overflow of text from its container when the words are extremely long. (maybe by decreasing the font size of the line when word gets loo long)
- Right now, there are only two input fields, and they don't apply to some memes. (can be fixed by adding text field for "middle text" and make the texts be able to positioned by dragging them)
- Next meme, Previous meme buttons instead of a single "Get new meme image" button.
- Be able to save the image containing the text in it, instead of just the image.
